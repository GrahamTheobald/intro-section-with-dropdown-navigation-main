## My process

Mobile first design approach. I attempted to structure the html in such a way that minimal work was needed to transition
to a desktop view.
To create the drop-down menus I utilised absolute positioning

### What I learned

I learned that the best way to stay in control of image sizes is to use the background-image property rather than styling
an img tag directly
